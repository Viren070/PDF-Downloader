# PDF Downloader
A Python program to download PDFs off websites using a GUI made with customtkinter

## How it works
You enter a URL and click search. You can then open the File Selector (or just click download all and be prompted for a download folder [not added yet though]). 

The File Selector allows you to select which files you want to edit and you can use the search bar at the top to search through the PDFs that were found on that URL. e.g. if you searched as-pure, only the PDFs that had that in either their original filenames or link will be showm. These can be selected and edited in batch. 

When you are done selecting which files you want to download and have changed the download folder and filenames, you can click download. A progress bar will show up and it will tell you the download speeds and percentage complete. It will also tell you how much time is left until the download finishes (not added yet)
